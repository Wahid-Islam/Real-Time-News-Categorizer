Real-Time News Categorizer with Sentiment Analysis

Description:
The Real-Time News Categorizer is a Python-based project leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to fetch and organize live news headlines from RSS feeds.
It categorizes news into predefined topics such as politics, sports, technology, and more, while also performing sentiment analysis to determine whether the tone
of the news is positive, negative, or neutral. Using libraries like Flask, TextBlob, and scikit-learn, this project combines machine learning and sentiment analysis
to provide users with insights into the latest news. The app presents a user-friendly interface where news is dynamically updated and categorized for easy browsing.
Each headline is accompanied by a brief summary, its sentiment, and a link to the full article. This project demonstrates the power of NLP in real-world applications
by enabling efficient content organization, real-time updates, and analytical insights into the tone of the news.
